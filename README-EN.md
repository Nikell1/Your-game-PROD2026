# PROD 2026 - Frontend

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Русскоязычная версия README доступна по ссылке - [README.md](README.md)

> [!TIP]
> The assignment can be found in a separate repository at the link – https://gitlab.prodcontest.com/2026-final-tasks/frontend

**Use this repository to work on a task.**

> [!WARNING]
> Remember! Modifying the .gitlab-ci.yml file is prohibited.

> [!WARNING]
> The submitted solution will be taken from the last commit in the main branch at the time of the deadline.

**To have your work evaluated, you must meet two conditions:**

1) The application must build static files into the `public` folder using the command `npm run build`

2) The application must be launchable with the command `npm ci && npm start` on an LTS version of Node.js. If the application does not start in this way, the score in the categories "Technical criteria" and "General impression of an expert" will be 0.

## How to find the deployed website?

Deployment occurs only when the main branch is updated.

If the deployment is successful, a `GitLab Pages` link will appear on the right side in the `Project information` section.


## Academic integrity and communication culture

We urge all participants to adhere to the principles of academic integrity and a culture of communication, and to approach competitions openly and in good faith. <br/>
The purpose of the Olympiad is not only to demonstrate your knowledge and skills, but also to develop as reliable and responsible specialists in the future.

### Academic integrity and loan screening

We check the independence of the solutions:

- internal verification of the organizers;
- external verification via Codechecker (an Anti-Plagiat company product).

You can use code from open sources, but it is important to specify the source in the comment next to the fragment or in the `README'. 

If you use LLM/neural networks (for example, to generate code snippets, tests, or documentation), please mark this, where appropriate, in a comment next to the fragment or a separate note in the `README`. <br/>
Important: **you are responsible for all the code in the repository**, including the generated fragments — you must understand exactly what you are adding, be able to explain the solution and check the result (correctness, security, extreme cases).

This will make it easy to check and confirm the independence of your work and remove possible issues during verification.

### Communication culture and ethics of participation

The Industrial Programming Olympiad is about a professional approach. Therefore, we expect a respectful and businesslike tone in the repository (commit messages, branch names, code comments, and discussions).

We do not accept profanity, insults and toxic behavior.

## Measures in case of violations

If we find a violation of academic integrity or a culture of communication, we can cancel the result of the work (including disqualification from the Olympiad). <br/>
The decision is made by the organizers based on the totality of signs and results of inspections.
